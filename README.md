Hey, welcome to my blog! You can access it [here](frontend-blog.pages.dev/).
This is an SPA I put together in my second year of university and have been maintaining since.  
This is where I post articles with my thoughts on game design from an amateur's point of view.  
Please reach out to me through any social media or my email listed on my blog if you have any suggestions or just want to talk, game design or not!

Thanks for stopping by!
