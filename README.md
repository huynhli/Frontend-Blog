Hey, welcome to my blog! You can access it [here](https://frontend-blog.pages.dev/).
This is a website I put together in my second year of university and have been maintaining since.  
I post articles with my thoughts on game design and games I've played.  
Please reach out to me through any social media or my email listed on my blog if you have any suggestions or just want to talk, game design or not!

Thanks for stopping by!
